Ungulates (or ‘Ungu’) are a bovine species characterised by their astounding physical strength. Due to their large build, they are unable to wear Nanotrasen-issue hardsuits, and instead must use two-piece softsuits for work that requires it.

# Diet and Metabolism
Ungu are vegetarian, and a standard diet consists of vegetables, fruit, and produce. Kudzu is a delicacy in Ungu culture.

Ungu have a much larger stomach than other humanoids, and require more intake to be completely satiated. In turn, they grow hungry at a much slower pace.

# Physical Strength
Hand-to-hand combat is a favoured pastime of Ungu. While their attacks are slower than other humanoids, they are far stronger, and can even deal structural damage. Ungu are known for their predilection towards charging their combatants, despite the possibility that they may sustain damage in the process.

 ## Ungu Naming Conventions

  The typical Ungu's name is three letters long, acting as a translation of the short bark-like sounds they use to address each other casually. The titles they add to their names are a shorthand for traditional greeting stories, as historically when meeting someone it is considered polite between Ungu to exchange a story about an important aspect of yourself or your life experiences.

  Ungu may often change their titles to reflect significant events or life circumstances. "Negative" titles aren't seen as shameful but rather as a sign of strength to move past something troubling or accept oneself.
